CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at tests/CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Drogon" with any
  of the following names:

    DrogonConfig.cmake
    drogon-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Drogon" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Drogon_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Drogon"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
